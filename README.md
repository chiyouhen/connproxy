# Connect Proxy by with Python3
I write this for learning python3 asyncio. It is very simple. No exception processing, only some simple lines and functions.

# TODO
1. Try to support all http method?
1. Try to rewrite code with transport? or protocol? or something else. I am new to write code with python3 and asyncio, I need to learn some good project.
