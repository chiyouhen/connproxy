# Connect Proxy with Python3
I wrote this for learning work with asyncio in python3. It is very simple. No exception processing, only some simple lines and functions.

# TODO
1. Try to support all http method?
1. Try to rewrite code with transport? or protocol? or something else. I am new to write code with python3 and asyncio, I need to learn some good project.
1. Try to make code modular?
